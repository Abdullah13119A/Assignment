# Assignment

This is a sample README file for a Cypress test project.

## Getting Started

To run the tests, first install Cypress:

npm install cypress


Then, navigate to the project directory and run the tests:

npx cypress run

Tests
The tests are located in the cypress/integration directory. Each test file is a separate spec file.

To run a specific test file, use the cypress run command with the --spec flag:

npx cypress run --spec my-test.spec.js

Debugging
If a test fails, you can use the cypress open command to open the Cypress Test Runner. This will allow you to debug the test and see what went wrong.

npx cypress open


## More Information

For more information on Cypress, please visit the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/).
This is just a sample README file. The specific contents of the file will vary depending on the specific project.

Here are some additional things to consider when creating a README file for a Cypress test project:

Include the name of the project and the version number.
List the dependencies that the project needs.
Describe the purpose of the tests.
List the steps on how to run the tests.
Include information on how to debug the tests.
Link to the Cypress documentation.

# Postman to run API Tests

To open a Postman collection file in Postman, you can follow these steps:

Open Postman.
Click on the Import button in the top left corner.
Select the Import File option and choose the JSON collection file from your local file system.
Click on the Import button to load the collection.
The collection will now be available in Postman under the Collections tab on the left sidebar.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when opening a Postman collection file in Postman:

The collection file must be in JSON format. If the file is not in JSON format, Postman will not be able to import it.
The collection file must be saved in the local file system. Postman cannot import collections that are stored in a remote location.
You can import multiple collection files at the same time. Simply select the files that you want to import and click on the Import button.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
