# Assignment

This is a sample README file for a Cypress test project.

## Getting Started

To run the tests, first install Cypress:

npm install cypress


Then, navigate to the project directory and run the tests:

npx cypress run

Tests
The tests are located in the cypress/integration directory. Each test file is a separate spec file.

To run a specific test file, use the cypress run command with the --spec flag:

npx cypress run --spec my-test.spec.js

Debugging
If a test fails, you can use the cypress open command to open the Cypress Test Runner. This will allow you to debug the test and see what went wrong.

npx cypress open
